\textbf{Introduction \& Goal} \
Our aim for this project was to explore the models concerning point reference data and observe how they performed on a scenario of interest to us. Specifically, we wanted to see how Gaussian Process Models and Thin Plate Splines could help us make use of bike trip data in the Bay Area by predicting the locations of where users would most likely start a trip from. In doing so we would be able to see which bike stations are the most popular (in demand) and whether there are other areas they could expand to in order to capture more potential customers.\
\
\textbf{Data Description} \
\
We downloaded the data from http://www.bayareabikeshare.com/open-data. There are two datasets that we mainly used recorded from 2014/09/01 to 2015/08/31 including station information(station ID, name, latitude, longitude, dockcount, city), trip information(time, start terminal, end terminal, duration in second). There are 70 bike stations located in 5 different Bay Area cities.

The target response variable we defined is the number of trips start from a specific bike station. We combined the two datasets and aggregated into year level, day of week and hour of day level of each station, respectively.

\textbf{Gaussian Process Model}

\textbf{Thin Plate Splines (TPS)} \
\
To fit TPS model, predictors are longitudes and latitudes of those 70 stations and response variables are the average number of trips starting from those stations. Then we used prediction coordinates, ‘pred_coords’, and the TPS model as input to predict the average number of trips, ‘trip_pred’.
